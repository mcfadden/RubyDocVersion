# RubyDocVersion for Safari


Safari Extension to automatically redirect to the correct version at ruby-doc.org

## Usage

#### Installation
[Download](https://github.com/mcfadden/RubyDocVersion/blob/master/RubyDocVersion.safariextz?raw=true) and open.

You'll need to "trust" the extension.

#### Settings

Safari menu > Preferences > Extensions > RubyDocVersion

Select the Version of Ruby you use.

## Notes

This requires full webpage permission so it can rewrite the URL. The source is really simple, so if that makes you nervous take a look.
